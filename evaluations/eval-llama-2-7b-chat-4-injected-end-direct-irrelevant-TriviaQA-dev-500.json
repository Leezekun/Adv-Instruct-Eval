[PAR] Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Dickinson began his career in music fronting small pub bands in the 1970s while attending school in Sheffield and university in London. In 1979, he joined the new wave of British heavy metal band Samson, with whom he gained some popularity under the stage name \"Bruce Bruce\" and performed on two studio records. He left Samson in 1981 to join Iron Maiden, replacing Paul Di'Anno, and debuted on their 1982 album The Number of the Beast. During his first tenure in the band, they issued a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums in the 1980s.

He rejoined the band in 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, with whom he has released five subsequent studio albums. Since his return to Iron Maiden, he issued one further solo record in 2005, Tyranny of Souls.

There are two distinct cultural traditions of dragons: [PAR] *European dragon, derived from  European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies. Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence, are uniqely sexrupeds (i.e. four legs and a detached set of wings). [PAR] *Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan (namely the Japanese dragon), Korea and other East Asian and South Asian countries.  Most are depicted as serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence, and are quadrupeds (i.e. four legs and wingless). [PAR] The two traditions may have evolved separately, but have influenced each other to a certain extent, particularly with the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries. The English word dragon and Latin word draco derives from Greek δράκων (drákōn), \"dragon, serpent of huge size, water-snake\".  [PAR] Name [PAR] The word dragon entered the English language in the early 13th century from Old French dragon, which in turn comes from Latin draconem (nominative draco) meaning \"huge serpent, dragon\", from the Greek word δράκων, drakon (genitive drakontos, δράκοντος) \"serpent, giant seafish\". The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological, and this usage was also current in English up to the 18th century. [PAR] Morphology [PAR] A dragon is a mythological representation of a reptile. In antiquity, dragons were mostly envisaged as serpents, but since the Middle Ages, it has become common to depict them with legs, resembling a lizard. [PAR] Dragons are usually shown in modern times with a body like a huge lizard, or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from their mouths. The European dragon has bat-like wings growing from its back. A dragon-like creature with wings but only a single pair of legs is known as a wyvern. [PAR] Comparative mythology [PAR] The association of the serpent with a monstrous opponent overcome by a heroic deity has its roots in the mythology of the Ancient Near East, including Canaanite (Hebrew, Ugaritic), Hittite and Mesopotamian. Humbaba, the fire-breathing dragon-fanged beast first described in the Epic of Gilgamesh is sometimes described as a dragon with Gilgamesh playing the part of dragon-slayer. The legless serpent (Chaoskampf) motif entered Greek mythology and ultimately Christian mythology, although the serpent motif may already be part of prehistoric Indo-European mythology as well, based on comparative evidence of Indic and Germanic material.  The folk-lore motif of the dragon guarding gold, may have come from earlier Bronze Age customs of introducing serpents to village granaries to deter rats or mice.  [PAR] Although dragons occur in many legends around the world, different cultures have varying stories about monsters that have been grouped together under the dragon label. Some dragons are said to breathe fire or to be poisonous, such as in the Old English poem Beowulf. They are commonly portrayed as serpentine or reptilian, hatching from eggs and possessing typically scaly or feathered bodies. They are sometimes portrayed as hoarding treasure. Some myths portray them with a row of dorsal spines. European dragons are more often winged, while Chinese dragons resemble large snakes. Dragons can have a variable number of legs: none, two, four, or more when it comes to early European literature. [PAR] Dragons are often held to have major spiritual significance in various religions and cultures around the world. In many Asian cultures dragons were, and in some cultures still are, revered as representative of the primal forces of nature, religion and the universe. They are associated with wisdom—often said to be wiser than humans—and longevity. They are commonly said to possess some form of magic or other supernatural power, and are often associated with wells, rain, and rivers. In some cultures, they are also said to be capable of human speech.  In some traditions dragons are said to have taught humans to talk.

Peter Bartok and Nelson O. Dellamaggiore) [PAR] Béla Bartók was born in Nagyszentmiklós, Hungary, now Sînnicolau Mare, Romania, on March 25, 1881, and died in New York City on September 26, 1945. He composed his ballet score The Wooden Prince between April 1914 and the spring of 1916 and carried out the orchestration in 1916-17, completing it in January of the latter year. The ballet was premiered May 12, 1917, at the Budapest Opera, with Egisto Tango conducting. Bartók undertook a revision of his score in 1932, at which point he introduced numerous cuts as well as new transitions to points of continuation. The San Francisco Symphony played the complete score of The Wooden Prince in February 2005 with David Zinman conducting; these are the first SFS performances of the Suite. The score calls for a large orchestra of four flutes (third and fourth doubling piccolos), four oboes (third and fourth doubling English horns), alto and tenor saxophones (the latter doubling baritone saxophone), four clarinets (third doubling E-flat clarinet, fourth doubling bass clarinet), four bassoons (third and fourth doubling contrabassoons), four horns, four trumpets, two cornets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, glockenspiel, xylophone, triangle, castanets, cymbals, snare drum, bass drum, tam-tam, celesta, two harps, and strings.

This is a scenario Wimbledon fans have seen before between Djokovic, Murray and Federer, but it is predicted that Djokovic will defend his title and come that much closer to a calendar-year Slam. For the women&rsquo;s side, the final match-up is expected to be against No. 1 Serena Williams and 2016 French Open winner, Garbine Muguruza.

Wright and George Forrest first succeeded on Broadway in 1944 with Song of Norway, in which they turned the music of Edvard Grieg into show tunes as a means of giving him a stage biography. In subsequent years, they attempted to repeat this trick with Victor Herbert , Franz Lehar, and Heitor Villa-Lobos , all without success until they hit upon the curious idea of using the music of Russian composer Alexander Borodin in a musical adaptation of Edward Knoblock's 1911 play Kismet, a fable about a poet-beggar in Baghdad who becomes emir in a single day and marries his daughter off to the caliph. Originating (as had Song of Norway) with the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera Association, the production moved to Broadway on December 3, 1953. With a newspaper strike raging in New York, there were no reviews and no print advertising, but Tony Bennett 's cover recording of \"Stranger in Paradise\" from the score (its tune adapted from Borodin 's \"Polovetsian Dances\") had hit the pop charts a week earlier, and its rising popularity drew customers to the show. It also had a superior cast going for it, led by well-established Broadway star Alfred Drake (Oklahoma!, Kiss Me, Kate) and Doretta Morrow (moving up from her supporting role in The King and I), and also featuring two stars on the rise in their first important roles, Richard Kiley and Joan Diener . It was this duo, in fact, who got to sing \"Stranger in Paradise,\" while Morrow handled the tuneful \"Baubles, Bangles and Beads,\" and Drake had fun with \"Rhymes Have I,\" \"Fate,\" and \"Gesticulate.\" As a score, Kismet managed to sound exotic yet still familiar, and the original Broadway cast performed the songs to perfection, making this an outstanding album. Kismet won six 1954 Tony Awards, including those for best musical, leading actor ( Drake ), and composer ( Borodin , who had been dead for 67 years!). It ran 583 performances on Broadway. This album peaked at number four in the Billboard chart, where it was listed for 23 weeks.

And, with a projected shortage of 1.5 million software engineers in the United States over the next ten years, our reliance on innovative Indian tech workers will only continue to grow. This makes the current tensions between the United States and India particularly troubling. Faltering economic growth in India, combined with America’s increased involvement in the conflicts raging in the Middle East, has moved the fostering of relations between the two nations further down on the list of priorities. Add to that a controversy last year following the arrest of a junior Indian diplomat in New York, considered unwarranted by many in the Indian government, and the result is that a once productive partnership between the world’s two biggest democracies has cooled significantly. [See What the United States Can Gain from Working Closer with India , by Vinod Dham, The Washington Post, 29.Sept.2014.] However, change may be on the horizon. In May 2014, India elected a new prime minister, Narendra Modi, in a landslide victory. He recently visited the U.S. for the first time to meet with President Obama in a promising effort to repair a strained relationship. [PAR] Modi’s summit conference with Obama is especially notable because, until his election as prime minister, he had been denied admission to the United States for nearly a decade. In 2005, Modi was officially banned from entering this country due to accusations that he failed to put a stop to rioting in which hundreds of Muslims were killed in the Indian state of Gujarat. Modi was chief executive of the state when the riots occurred in 2002, but has always denied any wrongdoing. Following the overwhelming victory of his conservative party this past spring, Obama was quick to congratulate the new prime minister and offer an invitation to the United States. This warm reception can be attributed, at least in part, to Modi’s emphasis on increasing Indian manufacturing, which is heavily reliant on American capital and technological advances. With India offering free access to its sizeable markets, it seems that a mutually beneficial partnership between the two nations is forming once again. [See U.S. Eager to Forget About New India Premier’s 2005 Visa Denial , by Shashank Bengali and Paul Richter, Los Angeles Times, 9.Sept.2014.] [PAR] The promise of a reinvigorated relationship between the United States and India comes just in time. As America’s thriving tech industry stands on the brink of a major workforce shortage, Prime Minister Modi’s willingness to move forward and forge an alliance may be the key to preserving our access to the skilled Indian engineers who have been so vital to our ability to innovate.

It is built on the site of the former Lansdowne Road stadium, which was demolished in 2007, and replacing it as home to its chief tenants: the Irish rugby union team and the Republic of Ireland football team. The decision to redevelop the stadium came after plans for both Stadium Ireland and Eircom Park fell through. Aviva Group Ireland signed a 10-year deal for the naming rights in 2009.  [PAR] The stadium, located adjacent to Lansdowne Road railway station, officially opened on 14 May 2010. The stadium is Ireland's first, and only, UEFA Elite Stadium and in 2011, it hosted the Europa League Final. It also hosted the inaugural Nations Cup, as well as the regular home fixtures of the national rugby team, national football team and some home fixtures for Leinster Rugby from August 2010 onwards. [PAR] Unlike its predecessor, which was solely owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), the current stadium is controlled by the IRFU and the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) through a 50:50 joint venture known as the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company (LRSDC). The joint venture has a 60-year lease on the stadium;  on expiry the stadium will return to the exclusive ownership of the IRFU.  [PAR] Facilities [PAR] The stadium is a bowl shape with four tiers on three sides of the ground; the lower and upper tiers being for general access, the second and third levels feed the second tier for premium tickets and the fourth tier for corporate boxes. The northern end of the stadium, due to its proximity to local housing, incorporates only the lower tier of the bowl. The North Stand is to be the away stand for football internationals.
