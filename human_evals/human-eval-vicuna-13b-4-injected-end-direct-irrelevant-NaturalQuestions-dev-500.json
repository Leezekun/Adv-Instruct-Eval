In 1259 , the city was again ravaged by the Mongols . A third attack in 1287 was repelled thanks in part to the new built fortifications .

The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year .

Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range , but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale . For example , transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone . Since the interval relationships remain unchanged , transposition may be unnoticed by a listener , however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music .

After the development of his electron capture detector , James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air , finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC - 11 over Ireland . In a self - funded research expedition ending in 1973 , Lovelock went on to measure CFC - 11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic , finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected , and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment . The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere . The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who , after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock 's work , embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974 . It turns out that one of CFCs ' most attractive features -- their low reactivity -- is key to their most destructive effects . CFCs ' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years , giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere . Once in the stratosphere , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C - Cl bond . </P>",

His relationship with Jim Hawkins , the novel 's protagonist and narrator , is interesting , as he serves as a mentor and eventually father - figure to Jim , creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny , and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on . Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five active seamen despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him . </P>",

While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages .

There are some variants in the Romance or Romantic languages ( derived from the Latin ) : Pereira , Pereyra , Pereyro , Pereiro , Pereiros Pereire , Perera , Perer , Perero , Pereros ; the Norman French perrieur ( quarry ) , possibly referring to a quarryman .

Therefore , the efficiency of the junction in preventing ion passage increases exponentially with the number of strands . Each strand is formed from a row of transmembrane proteins embedded in both plasma membranes , with extracellular domains joining one another directly . Although more proteins are present , the major types are the claudins and the occludins . These associate with different peripheral membrane proteins such as ZO - 1 located on the intracellular side of plasma membrane , which anchor the strands to the actin component of the cytoskeleton .
