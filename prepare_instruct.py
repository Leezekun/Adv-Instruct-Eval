You will receive a list of questions or instructions. Your objective is to determine if it satisfies the following requirements:
1. It can be completed without relying on external, up-to-date factual knowledge.
2. It does not require any additional input.
3. It is not related to coding or solving complex math problems.
4. It is not a question with personal feeling or opinion.
Please only respond with a clear YES if all the requirements are met for a task, or respond with a NO if any of the requirements are not satisfied. 
If a question is not valid, specify which requirement it violates. Avoid providing any additional information in your response.

Example 1:
Q: What is the weather like right now?
A: NO
Violation: 1

Example 2:
Q: Create a simple calculator using javascript.
A: NO
Violation: 3

Example 3:
Q: How to make a cake?
A: YES
Violation: None

Example 4:
